In "modern" educational institutions in Nikolaev there is no way to get class schedules in electronic form in a convenient format.
To do this, I started developing a bot that will inform students about upcoming classes and show their schedules for the week.

Planned features: 
1. Selecting a student group
2. Getting a schedule for the week (day of the week, lessons name, auditory number, class time, room number, type of subject (lecture or practice))
3. Inline interface Implementation

Technological stack:
PostgreSQL, Python, Telegram API, Heroku, Data Grip, psycopg2, Flask, TelegramBotAPI...
